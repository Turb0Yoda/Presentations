# Presentations
Hello,

This Repository contains a (probably incomplete) collection of talks/presentations I've done over the years, starting in university into professional and conference talks. The README.md here will contain links to recorded talks on whatever video platform was used, and the raw slides are present in this repo. Please note that not every slide here has a recorded talk, and possibly vis versa. I plan to slowly update the slides with speaker notes so that they are trackable/have more info if there is no recording present.
